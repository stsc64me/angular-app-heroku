# NG-ADMIN

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.

## Development server

Run `docker-compose up` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Create a feature module with routing
Next, youâ€™ll need a feature module with a component to route to. To make one, enter the following command in the terminal, where `customers` is the name of the feature module. The path for loading the `customers` feature modules is also `customers` because it is specified with the `--route` option.

More information of [Lazy Loading Feature Modules](https://angular.io/guide/lazy-loading-ngmodules).

```
ng generate module customers --route customers --module app.module
```
